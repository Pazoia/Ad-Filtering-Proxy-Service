```

This should return the current version of PostgreSQL installed, below is an example of what should be returned.

```
postgres (PostgreSQL) 14.6 (Homebrew)
```

> If you don't have PostgreSQL, you have to install it on your system.  
> Use the command below to install PostgreSQL with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
$  brew install postgresql
```

Once the installation is finished, run the command to check the version again.

### **Start PostgreSQL server**

> Use the command below to start the PostgreSQL server.

```
$ brew services start postgresql
```

### **Using PostgreSQL on terminal**

```
user=# CREATE DATABASE < your DB_NAME >;
```

You can check all your databases by using the command below, the newly created database should be listed there.
